Programming for accelerators such as GPUs is critical for modern AI systems.
This often means programming directly in proprietary low-level languages such as CUDA. [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton/) is an alternative open-source language that allows you to code at a higher-level and compile to accelerators like GPU.

Coding for Triton is very similar to Numpy and PyTorch in both syntax and semantics. However, as a lower-level language, there are a lot of details that you need to keep track of. In particular, one area that learners have trouble with is memory loading and storage which is critical for speed on low-level devices.

This set of puzzles is meant to teach you how to use Triton from first principles in an interactive fashion. You will start with trivial examples and build your way up to real algorithms like Flash Attention and Quantized neural networks. These puzzles **do not** need to run on GPU since they use a Triton interpreter.

## My Fork

I'm working through these puzzles to build tiling and memory access intuition
from the kernel level up. My background is in applied math and optimization,
and I'm currently learning compiler engineering (MLIR, IREE, LLVM). I find
that understanding how Triton's block/tile model maps to hardware memory
hierarchy directly informs compiler lowering decisions — e.g. tile size
heuristics, incomplete tile handling, and vectorization strategies.

Puzzles are solved in `Triton-Puzzles.ipynb` with inline comments connecting
each concept to compiler internals where relevant.
